        <p>
          A piece of art can be a simple splat of paint dispersed seemingly
          randomly on a sheet of canvas and still be worth billions. The
          brilliant thing about art is its inherent subjective worth. I
          specialize in simple star-shapes. Not unlike other artists, my works
          are of questionable quality. This is the essence of art.

          Flexbox has been used as there are only two div's in need of styling
          with position and layout (those containing the SVG and Canvas
          Elements). CSS Grid would have been more appropriate with several
          other div's - with need of styling with both rows and columns -

          <b>Canvas</b> is defined in an external js-file. jQuery is used to
          invoke actions on the Canvas, such as hover. <br />
          <b>SVG</b> is defined inline in the HTML due to the simplicity of the
          element. The interactive part is ensured by a simple css-command. This
          has the advantage of targeting the polygon itself, instead of the
          entire element. <b>jQuery</b> is imported in the script tag below, and
          used in index.js to simplify all the actions (.ready and .hover) on
          the elements in the html-file.
