          "A piece of art can be a simple splat of paint dispersed seemingly
          randomly on a sheet of canvas and still be worth billions. The
          brilliant thing about art is its inherent subjective worth. I
          specialize in simple star-shapes. Not unlike other artists, my works
          are of questionable intrinsic quality. This is the undeniable essence of art."

          <b>Flexbox</b> has been used as there are only two div's in need of styling
          with position and layout (those containing the SVG and Canvas
          Elements). CSS Grid would have been more appropriate with several
          other div's - with need of styling with both rows and columns -
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Relationship_of_Grid_Layout"
            >source</a
          >. In short, flexbox was regarded as the preferred (most effective) way to style this webpage. 
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Canvas</b> is drawn in an external js-file. jQuery is used to
          invoke actions on the Canvas, such as hover. jQuery also toggles this text.<br />
          <b>SVG</b> is defined inline in the HTML due to the simplicity of the
          element. The interactive part is ensured by a simple css-command. This
          has the advantage of targeting the polygon and circles themselves, instead of the
          entire element. <b>jQuery</b> is imported in the script tag below, and
          used in index.js to simplify all the actions (.ready and .hover) on
          the elements in the html-file.

          The website is tested in both Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome - two
          of the most used browsers. Functionality is tested, in addition to
          checking the console in each browser for errors or warnings. Some of
          the information used here was fetched from
