Questions

1) Why do mobile phones usually ignore auto play on video elements?

Autoplay videos can be data hungry and many users find the attribute to be disruptive and annoying. 

As of the release of IOS 10, the autoplay attribute is now honored in Safari(IOS devices). 
[Given the following conditions: 1:Contains no audio tracks, 2: Must be visible on screen, on the viewport, 
3: They must pause if they are scrolled out of visibility]

Chrome 53 and newer also allows autoplay (developers found hacks like GIFs etc to allow "video-autoplay" which uses way more data). 

2) The CSS snippet will not do anything. 

3) Mention some of the advantages of having a single responsive website instead of dedicated versions like m.til.no for mobile and til.no for desktop?

It is easier to maintain and update one single site. In addition, the redirect to the m(dot) sites is a con. 
Also, with all the available devices, developers does not need to make one page for tablets, desktops, phones, TVs and so on with the responsive solution
The URL is the same for all devices.
