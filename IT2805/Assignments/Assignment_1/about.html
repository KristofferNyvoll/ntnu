        <p>Aside from taking the "Information Technology 1 & 2" course in HS, my experience is very limited.
                Among my notable achievements is a simple shooting/hunting game and an arcade game involving the Millenium Falcon in space. </p>
        <p>It is worth noting that I've only programmed in ActionScript 3.0. HTML and CSS is nothing new to me, 
                but sadly most of it has been forgotten.</p>
        <p>I truly look forward to learning Javascript and freshing up on HTML and CSS. 
                Naturally, being able to create my own high-quality website is a realistic expectation (or so i hope).     
                My impression thus far is that we will be solving assignments on our own as well as working in groups to solve larger tasks. 
                Although the first couple of assignments are quite basic, i expect the course to be very challenging. 
                Reason being that there is always some improvement to be made</p>

        <li>The servers manage the files and connect directly to the network. They handle requests and reply with the correct adress</li>
        <li>The client is the user. He/she sends requests for a certain domain/adress. That request is handled by the servers and the client is redirected to the requested site.</li>
        <li>IP is short for Internet Protocol. The IP adress is unique for every computer, as is required for communication over the network. It can be regarded as a mail adress, because the mail cannot be delivered unless the mailbox has a valid adress. The same principle goes for IP adresses.</li>
        <li>DNS is short for Domain Name System. It contains the names of the domains (aka websites) and their respective IP adresses. In a way, it is similar to a phonebook, connecting names and numbers</li>
        <li>The world wide web is an information sharing model using the HTTP protocol.It is often confused with the internet, but the internet is a masive networking infrastructure. </li>
        <li>HTML, or Hypertext markup language, is the publishing language of the www. It handles the document structure and formatting.</li>
