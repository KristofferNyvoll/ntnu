Questions

1) What is the difference between position: absolute and position: fixed ?

"position: absolute" positions the element according to its ancestor element (if the ancestor is positioned and not static)
"position: fixed" positions the element relative to the browser window. 
The difference between the two is that the "fixed" property only cares about where it is in the browser window, where the absolute 
property places the element relative to other elements in the code.

2) With CSS3, how do we access the third element within another element?

We can use the :nth-child(n) - selector. If n=1, you select the first child of their parent. To select the third element in element1, the code will be the following:
element1:nth-child(3) {
	...
}
